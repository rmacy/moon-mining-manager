### Development Environment

You can use Docker to run the app.

Start the dev containers and shells:
```
docker-compose up
docker-compose exec moon_php /bin/sh
docker-compose run moon_node /bin/sh
```

Generate files and annotations with the IDE Helper for Laravel:
```
php artisan ide-helper:generate
php artisan ide-helper:meta
php artisan ide-helper:models
```

Run the queue:
```
php artisan schedule:run
php artisan queue:work
```

To run a single job use, e.g.:  
(Simply add constructor arguments after the class name.)
```
php artisan command:run-job PollStructures 2113076059
```

## Initial setup

- Add your admin user to the table `whitelist` with `is_admin` = `1`. They can now log in and authorise other users.
- Add the following mail templates to the table `templates`: `weekly_invoice`, `receipt`, `renter_invoice`,
  `renter_notification`, `renter_reminder`.
- Login at http://your.domain/admin with a director of your corporations to create the required ESI tokens. Add the
  IDs to the environment variables `*_PRIME_USER_ID`.
- Login at http://your.domain/admin with a character that should be used to send mails and add the ID to the
  environment variable `MAIL_USER_ID`.

## Operation instructions

* Run `php artisan queue:work` to start the job queue process. See the
  [Laravel documentation on Queues](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues) for more information on how to use
  Supervisor to manage job queues.
* Add a Cron for the [Task Scheduler](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/scheduling)

## Further Configuration

Login with you admin user and configure the application:

- Edit the mail templates at "Manage Emails".
- Set the tax for each ore (the list will be populated automatically by a cron job).
- Make sure at least one character receives mails from the contact form (at "Settings") or set up a Slack hook.
- Import moon data.
